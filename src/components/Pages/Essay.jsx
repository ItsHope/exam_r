           In this paper I do an analysis on the net art called "SCREENFULL" by Abe Linkoln and Jimpunk developed in 2004 till 2005 (Available here: http://www.screenfull.net/stadium/). This is net art addresses my area of interest conceptually, aesthetically and technically. For my last assignment my interest and final net artwork came down to presenting or displaying multimedia in interesting and creative ways or creating experimental collages. I created an interactive collage to showcase Jack Stauber's artwork. Jack Stauber is an artist and animator known for his unique art style that can be described as odd, surreal and chaotic, his overall style is very unconventional. My design goals were to create a blog in theme with his art style. I fell short and was limited by still wanting familiarity in my blog for easy usability and this is why I resonate with Screenfull particularly. Screenfull surpassed my vision of what a functional chaotic website would look and feel like. It is truly experimental and looks like a blog by Jack Stauber. It is an interesting net artwork. To define what net art is, net art is "a self-explanatory term that is created by a malfunctioning piece of software originally used to create an art and communications activity that is on the internet" (Bookchin and Shulgin, 1999 as cited in Park, 2007). The essence of net art is to push a lot of boundaries. Screenfull pushed a lot of boundaries. According to Net Art Anthology at the time of development, Screenfull was a response to the new web 2.0 with unique blogging but it was also an attempt to break it. The artists of Screenfull describe and claim that they have created a website with so much media that it will crash your computer, "the project was loud and crowded, it took a rather maximalist approach to design and content" (Net Art Anthology). After having viewed the site, I find that the description cannot be more accurate.From the period of 2004 to 2005 the co-creators frequently blogged looped videos, images that seem abstract at first glance and of course the audio, the audio for me emphasized the overwhelming experience the creators promised, it is always played at full blast and does not start playing right away. My first time experiencing this I thought someone had hacked into my machine. The whole blog is a multilayered collage. This collage consists of media that just seems to be working to overload the user as the creators intended but the media is intentional and speaks on controversial topics like war, religion, UFO's just to name a few. Some webpages even contain content about net art and its artists, how anonymity and aliases were a significant part of early net art. Both creators did not go by their real names at the time, Abe Linkoln and Jimpunk are artist or created names for the individuals. This made me think about a statement made by Ji Yong Park in his paper " Design principles for interactive user experience through net art" about net artworks having an element of activism "An understanding of artists that create net art as activists in cyberspace is very crucial to understanding web design principles in terms of the user experience" (Park, 2007). There are provocative sounds with swearing that play over each other, one is usually someone speaking, and the rest is different songs, all to communicate a message and in some webpages to bring about a certain reaction. The images and videos on the blog are placed without containers, they are different sizes, and some are overlayed. The images are altered and have effects. The images are internet sourced images that are photoshopped to have a particular aesthetic. "The posts often make use of Photoshopâ€™s blinking magnetic lasso tool" (Net Art Anthology). The placement of elements seems very random and not thought of. In general, the interface is unconventional and as intended the user is likely to experience some sensory overload and shock. " The audience is shocked because traditional conventions function not only as options for the artist but also as expectations for his viewers or readers"(Mailloux, 1983). Since this is intended and it aligns with the design goals of wanting to, "crash your browser with content"(Net Art Anthology) this was greatly achieved. Some webpages even do feel like a crashing page because they take time to load all the content, the pitch-black landing page itself seems broken until you click on the link that directs you to the homepage.The description of net art above highlighted the significance of the internet in the phenomena of net art, the blog as art would not be without the internet. The internet brings about interaction with website elements like buttons, images, play and pause audio features to get an output. Screenfull makes use of a lot of buttons that are all white with black text like the rest of the text on the homepage. The buttons don't look like conventional buttons, they don't even function like conventional buttons that usually animate on hover. I was able to distinguish their function because of the change in cursors when you hover over them. Upon interaction and clicking on them, users are directed to different webpages with different content. The site is significantly overloaded with buttons that lead to webpages with even more buttons. It felt like an endless cycle. For me that's when an element of adventure and storytelling I felt was introduced. I got lost between webpages with unique interfaces, colorways, images and audio. Each webpage told a unique story and featured distinct interaction, some webpages contained buttons and that opened popup boxes for commentary. The layout and aesthetic of the images and flash videos make use of the internet. The implementation of such functionality and strategic placing is using computer Technlogies and code. Other images in webpages seem non-interactive until you click on them and a box with animated text pops up. The message usually emphasizes the content on that particular page. Almost all the webpages on Screenfull have at least 3 audio elements on a single page with music playing over each other. As a user you can interact with the pause and play buttons as well as the volume functionality. You can choose to listen to an audio sound at time and at which volume percentage or even no sound at all. I really enjoyed this optionality because I was able to focus and read, in general focus and understand one type of media at a time. This is a part which makes me lean with Screenfull being functional. The internet makes this project. In conclusion, Screenfull is an impressive net art today so I cannot image the impact it had in the early 2000s. It is not conventional and does not consider a lot of web design rules such as having a consistent header in all webpages, having a footer. The blog does not consider colour theory, text sizing and element placement. Iman Raffee You touch on important points here but do not delve into them. This is a crucial discussion for your essay but the argument is a bit limited and does not fully elaborate on the use of the internet as a medium in the work. [...] Yet the blog still functions, some design rules were still followed to some extent. Cursors change to indicate button functionality. There is consistency in the colour of elements. The site is also responsive. I feel that that if the artists wanted to create a familiar blog and post blogs they would have done that. Screenfull is fascinating and intentional even though it does not feel like it and anyone with a tolerance of experimental art would appreciate it. It is true to the essence of net art, it pushes boundaries and is an experience. I have went over the blog multiple times and still find new media to look at, new educational content to engage with, and that is the beauty of this project.Yet the blog still functions, some design rules were still followed to some extent.
