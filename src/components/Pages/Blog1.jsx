        The Javascript videos personally helped me. I took down notes and had a lot of aha moments about what Javascript is and how it works. There were confusing parts that I will continue to go through. I know its going to take a lot of practice to fully get familiar with the fundamentals and it will pay off when its time to create my web art as I have been drawn to art that is going to need me to have somewhat strong coding skills. I really really loved Khutso Nkadimeng's internet art that explored the ideas of internet geopolitics and access. I found the readings interesting and the concept of web art interesting in general. I'm a fan of the internet. I think humans are brilliant for the internet and anything that is good becomes better with the internet or rather has potential to. In The Work of Art in the Age of the Internet by David, he speaks on how today, the original artifact matters less than the reproductions. "You see the work better – that is, closer, in more detail – online than in person" (Carrier, 202). I watched an online gallery once during the national lockdown and the experience was beautiful. I was immersed because of the music, the special effects etc.
