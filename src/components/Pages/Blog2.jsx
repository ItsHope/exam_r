         The API videos were informative, the real test for full understanding will be me actually working with API's and extracting data or even more advanced live data online. Getting these concepts and JavaScript in general is going to require real consistent practice, at least that's how I learn. I have though made a lot of progress in my skills. Week 4's reading was interesting. Steven Mailloux discusses the concept of convention and context in literature deeply, which made me think about conventions in general and my understanding of them. One part of the paper that I found interesting was his discussion of the theorist, Bert O. States. States explains how traditional conventions are established, "through observation of an innovative practice", he claims that the innovative shocks the audience and even the medium. (States as quoted in Mailloux, 1983). This brings about adoption of the practice if the other artists adopt the practice. This was interesting to me because of the "if", it meant that conventions relied on unity. Paul Alpers another theorist, revealed in his thesis that "convening reminds us that conventions describe individuals coming together". If other artists do not adopt the innovative practice, there will not be a new convention, there is no guarantee, it's all by chance unless a prescriptive convection. This reliance on unity, for me further emphasized the definition Mailloux gave at the beginning of the paper. Conventions refer to "shared practices". Prescriptive conventions though,mean the community in question is put pressure on to follow a certain way of doing things, but outside of literature, how? Is this done legally? These are the questions I was left with. Through the examples made in Mailloux's commentary, I agree that context is significant in both traditional convention and prescriptive convention. Both explanatory concepts are context specific. The reading helped me also think about conventions within web art like interactivity and conventions within web design like navbar placements etc. References- Few, S. (2007).

I am still stuck on colourful visuals and meaning interaction for my internet art.
