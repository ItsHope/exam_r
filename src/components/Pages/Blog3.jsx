         My choice of net/web art to analyze is Indirect Flights. This piece of art is one I had to grow to understand. At first glance it is chaotic and hard to make out of. But like what internet art means, the tools that the internet offers make it better. If I would, I would say the internet tools give it an aura. Benjamin describes the aura as “a phenomena’s uniqueness” (Benjamin, 2015). His theory suggests that every original piece of art has an aura, for example, “the aura of the sunset, the aura of nature” (Benjamin, 2015) that cannot be replaced. Therefore, mechanically or technologically reproduced art refuses to appreciate or acknowledge that aura. I arguably suggest that internet tools give art that aura, things like interactivity and animation. Benjamin speaks on this in "The Work Of Art In The Age Of The Internet" by acknowledging the aura in netart "art on the internet still has evidence of contemplative emersion that usually is lost in mechanically reproduced art". While viewing Indirect Flight, I found myself staring like I normally would at an original artpiece. I look at every colour and every element, all the details. I will say in detail because the internet offers tools to view visuals better. “The display system has changed, you see the work better, close ups and etc.” (Carrier, 2020). A lot of my classmates and Danae argued that net art can be seen as clunky, uncool and old fashioned. I felt that for a lot of the net art I viewed, Indirect Flight can be seen as that too. I argue though that this is only the case at first glance. I don't think viewers in the 80s were able to view art like how we do. With just how clear it is, I was able to appreciate and see the creators vision, I hope. The layering of the images is so odd and captivating, and I think internet art is only going to get even better with interactivity emerging and technology improving. Net Art pieces can also be viewed with music to assist with immersion just like Indirect Flights and my Internet Artwork (The collage). That makes the experience so much better.
